# image-slider

This project is a responsive and interactive Image Slider that allows users to view a series of images in an engaging, modern interface. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on user experience and visual appeal.

Key Features
Auto-Sliding Images
The slider automatically transitions between images every 3 seconds, creating a seamless and hands-free experience.

Manual Navigation
Users can navigate through the images using "Previous" and "Next" buttons. These buttons are designed with stylish Font Awesome icons, enhancing the overall look.

Smooth Animations
Transitions between images are fluid and visually appealing, thanks to smooth CSS animations.

Infinite Loop
The slider seamlessly loops back to the first image after reaching the last one, and vice versa.

Responsive Design
The slider is designed to fit perfectly within a 500px by 300px frame, making it compact and visually appealing. It is centered on the screen and adapts well to various viewport sizes.

Clean Aesthetic
The slider features rounded corners, soft shadow effects, and a light beige background for a polished and modern look.

How It Works
HTML Structure:
The slider consists of a container that holds all images and navigation buttons. Images are arranged horizontally and shifted left or right based on user interaction or the auto-slide mechanism.

CSS Styling:
The design includes a centered layout, rounded corners, box shadows, and hover effects for buttons. The sliding effect is achieved through a smooth transition on the image container.

JavaScript Logic:

The script handles automatic sliding by incrementing the image index at regular intervals.
Navigation buttons allow users to manually change the image index. Button clicks reset the timer, ensuring a smooth user experience.
Boundary checks ensure the slider loops back to the first or last image when necessary.
Usage Instructions
Setup:

The project requires no additional setup; just open the HTML file in a modern web browser.
Navigation:

Use the Next button to move to the next image.
Use the Previous button to go back to the previous image.
Customization:

Update the images by replacing the default image URLs in the HTML.
Adjust the dimensions, colors, or interval time by editing the CSS and JavaScript.
